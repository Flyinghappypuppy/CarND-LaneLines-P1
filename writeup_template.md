**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report

### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

My pipeline consisted of 5 steps. First, I converted the images to grayscale, then I .... 

Convert to Gray Scale
Apply Gausian Blur
Apply Canny
Select region 
Hough Transformation


Solution


In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function by ...
Filter based on angle and intercept
Filter outliers using greedy last 10 values SD
To smoothen the line draw - used a weighted average of current line with mean of Last N lines
Fill in frames with no lines with mean of last N
Use the weighted average to extrapolate 

If you'd like to include images to show how the pipeline works, here is how to include an image:

### 2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline


One potential shortcoming would be what would happen when ... 
There can be some types of noise/bad lines which can pass thought the thresholds of my fliters and adversely affect the mean slope and intercept causing it to deviate. Examples: Duplicate lanes, merging lanes, shadows, line like defarmations/objects on road. Static filters tuned for particular samples cannot adapt to varying conditions like the ones mentioned above. 

Another shortcoming could be ...
Constantly Winding Roads will affect the mean, the current last N mean size is static value and it tuned to better perform for roads that dont bean as often. A dynamically adjusting N value is needed to account for rapid changes in road direction.


### 3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline

A possible improvement would be to ...
Color conversion or RGB transformation of the image to a form which supresses noises like shadow and which hightlight the lanes more in the images

Another potential improvement could be to ...
Dyanmically adjusting or Self tuning of parameters based on the type of road and video. Specially parameters of: Region selection, angle and intercept filters,  Outlier filters and Line smoothing.
